**This mod requires some case trimming**, and I would recommend abandoning your charging dock contacts. More information available in the instructions page.

# Changes for New 3ds XL/reasons for the fork

The original PCB designed by rorosaurus doesn't fit the NEW 3ds xl as you can see in the picture.

This new design allows the mod to work for the NEW 3ds XL.

## The truly universal USB-C dream is finally realized for your Nintendo 3DS XL!

Charge your Nintendo 3DS XL with USB-C, using any USB-C cable and charger! If it fits, it'll charge! Finally you can stop carrying around that extra proprietary cable!

My design is inspired by [this existing PCB](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/I6UOH6gb) that only works with ````USB-A -> USB-C```` cables. In my opinion, if you're gonna future-proof your 3DS XL, you shouldn't remain reliant on Type-A!

My PCB works with ````USB-C <-> USB-C```` cables as well, so you can use ANY USB-C cable/charger to charge it! I've also verified it works with ````USB-A -> USB-C```` cables, Quick Charge, and USB-PD! That means if your charger or USB battery pack offers 5V/9V/12V/etc., it will recognize the 3DS XL can only accept 5V and charge accordingly.

**No 3D-printed part is included**, but the file is available for you to print yourself, if you want.


# Charge Speed

This console's original charger (WAP-002) outputs up to 900mA at 4.6V. According to the USB-C spec, this mod will allow charging at up to 500mA at 5V. This is, on paper, 40% slower charging than with the WAP-002.

However, in my testing, my console consumed 800mA at 5.1V, charging just as fast as the WAP-002. So please keep in mind that your mileage may vary, based on what USB charger you use and how precisely that charger follows the USB specification. Just be aware in the worst case, your console might charge a little slower.
